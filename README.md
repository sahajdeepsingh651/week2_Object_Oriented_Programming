# Week 2: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java üöÄ

Welcome to **Week 2** of our Java learning journey!  
This week, we delved into the core concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, a paradigm that models real-world entities using objects and classes to create modular, reusable, and maintainable code.

## üìù Overview

In this week, we transitioned from procedural programming to the object-oriented paradigm, exploring how Java leverages OOP principles to create robust and scalable applications. We covered the four pillars of OOP: **Encapsulation**, **Abstraction**, **Inheritance**, and **Polymorphism**, and learned how to implement them in Java.

## üìå Topics Covered

### Day 1: Procedural vs. Object-Oriented Programming

- Understanding the differences between procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms.
- Advantages of OOP over procedural programming.
- Real-world analogies to grasp OOP concepts.

### Day 2: Classes and Objects

- Defining classes and creating objects in Java.
- Understanding instance variables and methods.
- The role of the `main` method in Java applications.

### Day 3: Constructors, Instance vs. Class Variables, Access Modifiers

- Purpose and types of constructors.
- Differentiating between instance (non-static) and class (static) variables.
- Access control using `private`, `protected`, and `public` modifiers.

### Day 4: `this`, `static`, `final` Keywords, and `instanceof` Operator

- Using the `this` keyword to refer to the current object.
- Understanding the `static` keyword for class-level members.
- Utilizing the `final` keyword to create constants and prevent inheritance.
- Employing the `instanceof` operator to check object types.

### Day 5: Object Modeling and Class Diagrams

- Introduction to object modeling techniques.
- Creating class diagrams to represent system architecture.
- Understanding object diagrams and sequence diagrams.

### Day 6: Inheritance and Polymorphism

- Implementing single-level, multilevel, and hierarchical inheritance.
- Overriding methods to achieve runtime polymorphism.
- Constructor inheritance and the use of `super` keyword.

### Day 7: Encapsulation, Interfaces, and Abstract Classes

- Encapsulating data using private variables and public getters/setters.
- Defining interfaces to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance.
- Creating abstract classes and understanding their role in OOP.
